# Climate-adaptitoner-database
A centralized, Google Sheets–based database and future analytics platform built from the Registry of Adaptation Practitioners to support search, insights, and strategic planning for climate adaptation work in California.

**The Platform Enables Users to:** 
Search adaptation practitioners and organizations
Filter by location, hazard, sector, services, and organization type
Identify trends in adaptation work across California
Explore gaps in practitioner coverage by region, hazard, or sector
Support data-driven planning and partnerships

**How It Works**
Data is sourced from the Registry of Adaptation Practitioners
Practitioner and organization records are standardized into a Google Sheets database
Each row represents one practitioner or organization
Checkbox-enabled columns support filtering and analytics
The sheet is designed for future integration into a web-based search and analytics interface
Data Structure (Google Sheets)

**Deployment**
This tool is designed to be embedded into a Squarespace site using a Code Block.

Steps:
1. Publish the Google Sheet to the web as a CSV
2. Copy the Google Sheets CSV URL
3. Paste the contents of "search" into a Squarespace Code Block
4. Save and publish the site

**Updating Data**
No structural changes are required to update content. Data can be maintained by editing the Google Sheet, provided column headers and formats remain consistent.

**Deliverables**
Google Sheets database populated from the Registry of Adaptation Practitioners and independent research
Standardized, analytics-ready column structure
Foundation for future search, visualization, and analytics tools

**Impact**
This project improves transparency, accessibility, and understanding of California’s adaptation landscape while providing Complexity with a scalable, data-driven foundation for decision-making and public engagement.
