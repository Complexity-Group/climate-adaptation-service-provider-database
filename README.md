# Climate-adaptitoner-database
A centralized, Google Sheets–based database and future analytics platform built from the Registry of Adaptation Practitioners to support search, insights, and strategic planning for climate adaptation work in California.

Adaptation Practitioners Database & Analytics Platform
This project creates a standardized, accessible database of adaptation practitioners and organizations across California, serving as a foundational resource for Complexity users and the public.
The database is designed to support future website integration with search, filtering, and analytics capabilities.

The Platform Enables Users to:
Search adaptation practitioners and organizations
Filter by location, hazard, sector, services, and organization type
Identify trends in adaptation work across California
Explore gaps in practitioner coverage by region, hazard, or sector
Support data-driven planning and partnerships

**How It Works**
Data is sourced from the Registry of Adaptation Practitioners
Practitioner and organization records are standardized into a Google Sheets database
Each row represents one practitioner or organization
Checkbox-enabled columns support filtering and analytics
The sheet is designed for future integration into a web-based search and analytics interface
Data Structure (Google Sheets)

Each row represents a practitioner or organization. Proposed columns include:
Contact Name
Email
Website
Phone Number
Organization Location
Community Specializations
Organization Type
Services Provided
Hazard Expertise
Sector Expertise
Size of Communities Served
Geographic Areas of Work
Analytics & Insights
The database supports analysis of:
Most common adaptation topics and hazards in California
Most frequently provided services
Sector representation and gaps
Underserved regions and communities
Hazards and sectors with limited practitioner coverage
These insights inform strategic planning, program development, and partnerships.

**Website Integration**
The database is designed to power a future website interface featuring:
Keyword search
Filters by location, hazard, sector, services, and organization type
Statistics dashboard with practitioner counts
Visual summaries of trends and gaps
Public-facing summaries and internal analytical views for Complexity staff

**Deployment**

Current phase focuses on database creation in Google Sheets.
Future deployment will involve connecting the sheet to a website-based search and analytics interface.

**Updating Data**
No structural changes are required to update content. Data can be maintained by editing the Google Sheet, provided column headers and formats remain consistent.

**Deliverables**
Google Sheets database populated from the Registry of Adaptation Practitioners
Standardized, analytics-ready column structure
Foundation for future search, visualization, and analytics tools

**Impact**
This project improves transparency, accessibility, and understanding of California’s adaptation landscape while providing Complexity with a scalable, data-driven foundation for decision-making and public engagement.
